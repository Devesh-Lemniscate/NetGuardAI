## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Auto-Refresh Settings
- **Short interval (1-2s):** Best for active monitoring, uses more CPU
- **Medium interval (3-5s):** Balanced for most use cases
- **Long interval (7-10s):** Lower CPU, good for background monitoring

### Tip 2: Time Filtering
- Use "Last 5 minutes" for real-time monitoring
- Use "Last 1 hour" for recent trend analysis
- Use "All time" for comprehensive reports

### Tip 3: Exporting Data
- Export regularly during long captures
- Use timestamps to organize exports
- Combine multiple exports for long-term analysis

### Tip 4: ML Model
- Train model before starting analyzer for ML predictions
- Retrain periodically with real data for better accuracy
- Check confidence scores - high confidence = reliable predictions

### Tip 5: Threat Detection
- Not all alerts are real threats (false positives possible)
- Check multiple tabs for confirmation
- Export threat reports for security team review

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### System Requirements:
- Python 3.12+ with virtual environment
- Sudo access for packet capture
- Network interface access
- ~100MB RAM for normal operation

### Limitations:
- Stores max 10,000 packets in memory (prevents overflow)
- ML predictions based on 5-second windows
- Real-time analyzer requires sudo
- Auto-refresh increases CPU usage

### Security:
- Packet capture requires elevated privileges
- Data stored locally (not transmitted)
- ML model runs locally
- No external dependencies for operation
